<p>I chose web developmets as my go-to programing language because, for me it's straight forward, and i'm able to understand and work through problems as they occur, and solve them. I have several websites that anyone of any platform can enjoy.

  I also have taken classes of cyber-security, At lonestar college. I have experience with routers and switches, that connect to our internet.

<p>I currently live in Richmond Texas. This area is one the safest places around Houston. I like this side of town. It is quiet, and a lot is crouded than the general Houston area.</p>
